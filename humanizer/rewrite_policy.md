# Humanizer Rewrite Policy

Humanizer is a governor, not a cosmetic filter.

Apply Humanizer at 3 points:
1) Pre-draft constraints: steer the model away from smells
2) Post-draft rewrite: remove smells while preserving facts
3) Lexicon updates: detect repeated smells and propose additions

Never:
- introduce new facts
- change numbers
- remove required compliance language
